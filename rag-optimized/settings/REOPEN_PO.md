# REOPEN_PO - iPurchase System Setting

**Category:** Purchase Orders

Comma separated list of User ID's or Group ID's that are allowed to re-open a closed or cancelled PO via a change order. Asterisk indicates everyone, a blank indicates no one.

### How It Works

This setting uses [Can-Do list format](../../reference/can-do-list-format.md) for specifying users and groups.

**Common patterns:**
- `*` - Everyone/all values allowed
- (blank) - No one/feature disabled
- `user1,user2` - Specific users only
- `group1,!user1` - Group members except specific user
