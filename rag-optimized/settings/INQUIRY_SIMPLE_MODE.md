# INQUIRY_SIMPLE_MODE - iPurchase System Setting

**Category:** Reporting & Inquiry

Comma separated list of User ID's or Group ID's who only gets to see "Views" on inquiry screen and does not see all the filter fields. This can be used as requisition security. Asterisk indicates everyone, a blank indicates no one.

### How It Works

This setting uses [Can-Do list format](../../reference/can-do-list-format.md) for specifying users and groups.

**Common patterns:**
- `*` - Everyone/all values allowed
- (blank) - No one/feature disabled
- `user1,user2` - Specific users only
- `group1,!user1` - Group members except specific user
