# APPLICATION_URL - iPurchase System Setting

**Category:** Email Configuration

Full application URL used by scheduled jobs and background processes to generate clickable links in email notifications.

### How It Works

Background jobs (like escalation emails, approval reminders, and PO notifications) run outside the web context and don't know the application's URL. This setting provides that information so emails contain correct, clickable links.

**Important considerations:**
- Must include protocol (https://) and full hostname
- Should NOT include trailing slash
- Must be updated when migrating to test/backup environments
- Affects all email links generated by scheduled jobs

**Example:**
```
APPLICATION_URL = "https://ipurchase.company.com"
```

Links in emails will then appear as:
- `https://ipurchase.company.com/requisition.html?req=T0408319`

### Valid Values

Full URL string including protocol.

### Common Questions

- Why are email links going to the wrong server?
- How do I fix broken links in notification emails?
- What URL should I use for test environments?
