# PO_NBR_USE_QAD - iPurchase System Setting

**Category:** Purchase Orders

Controls whether purchase order numbers are generated by iPurchase or by the QAD ERP system.

### Valid Values

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **TRUE** | PO numbers generated by QAD system |
| **FALSE** | PO numbers generated by iPurchase (DEFAULT) |

### How It Works

When iPurchase creates purchase orders, it needs to assign PO numbers. This setting determines the source of those numbers:

**FALSE (iPurchase generates):**
- iPurchase maintains its own PO number sequence
- Numbers assigned immediately when PO is created
- Can use PO_PREFIX_FIELD for custom prefixes
- More control over numbering format

**TRUE (QAD generates):**
- QAD ERP assigns the PO number during integration
- Ensures PO numbers match QAD's sequence
- Required when QAD is the system of record for PO numbering
- May result in temporary placeholder numbers until QAD sync

### Common Questions

- Who assigns purchase order numbers?
- How do I integrate PO numbering with QAD?
- Why are my PO numbers different than expected?
